# This script is deprecated, please use [Better Random Media](https://github.com/Lordmau5/firebot-script-better-random-media) going forward.

## Effectively it's the same but the IDs have been changed and there is now also a `Play Random Sound` effect.

I highly recommend to download the "newest" version of this script as well since it will rename the `Better Random Video` effects to `Better Random Video (DEPRECATED)` so you can easily spot them and are able to copy the settings to the new effect.
